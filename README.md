# terminal demo app

Note that this demo is not intended to be used in production.  This does not implement
a lot of error handling, and is not fully secure.  This is only intended to be an example 
to illustrate the interactions between the components of the Stripe Terminal, the front end, and the backend.

## Demo layout

This app consists of:

1. A frontend written with our Terminal Javascript SDK (`./frontend-js`)
1. A backend implemented in two languages: Node (`./node`) and PHP (`./php`).  You only need one of these

Note that this demo does not handle the initial reader setup required to bind the reader to your Stripe account

## Running this demo

1. Choose the backend you want to use
1. Copy `.env.example` into the folder for the relevant backend and rename it to `.env`.  
1. Put in your Stripe account's publishable and secret keys into `.env`
1. Setup the environment for the backend (assuming you already have node or php and composer installed)
   1. If node, run `npm install` from the node folder
   1. If php, run `composer install` from the php folder
1. Run the backend server
   1. If node, run `npm start` from the node folder
   1. If php, run `php -S localhost:4242 index.php` from the php folder
1. Open `./frontend-js/index.html` in your browser
1. Click the buttons to walk through an end to end example
